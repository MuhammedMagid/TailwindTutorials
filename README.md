# Tailwind CSS Tutorial 2 - Blog Homepage Project 

This project is the second tutorial in a series to practice and learn Tailwind CSS. The goal is to create a basic blog homepage with Tailwind CSS for styling, demonstrating responsive design, layout management, and link navigation between pages.

## Project Overview

This project consists of a homepage and two additional pages:
- **Home Page (`index.html`)**: The main page displaying recent posts, categories, and a welcome section.
- **About Page (`about.html`)**: A simple informational page about the blog.
- **Contact Page (`contact.html`)**: A contact page with basic information.

Each page is styled using Tailwind CSS to provide a consistent layout and responsive design.

## Features

- **Responsive Navigation Bar**: A sticky header with links to navigate between pages.
- **Responsive Footer**: A footer that stays at the bottom of the page.
- **Content Sections**: Includes recent posts, categories, and text content, all styled with Tailwind CSS.
- **Dark Mode Support**: Dark background and text colors adapt using Tailwind CSSâ€™s dark mode utility classes.
